# speech-reader

This project is a simple web application that allows users to input text and have it read out loud using the browser's speech synthesis capabilities. The application also provides predefined phrases that can be read aloud.

-Text to Speech: Users can input any text into a textarea, and by clicking the "Read Text" button, the application will use the browser's built-in speech synthesis to read the text aloud.

-Predefined Phrases: The application provides a set of predefined phrases related to common expressions like being thirsty, hungry, happy, sad, etc. Users can click on these phrases, and the application will read them out loud.

-Voice Selection: Users can choose from different available voices for text-to-speech conversion. The voices can be selected from a dropdown menu.
